            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>As a Cloud Engineer, I design, build, and manage the digital infrastructure that powers modern businesses. My role goes beyond servers and networks — it’s about enabling organizations to be more agile, cost-efficient, and innovative.
              Cloud Engineers help companies move away from traditional IT systems and into scalable, secure cloud environments. This transformation allows businesses to:
              Scale easily as demand grows, cut costs by only paying for what they use, stay secure with enterprise-grade protections, innovate faster with automation, AI, and modern cloud tools.
              What excites me about being a Cloud Engineer is the constant challenge and evolution. The cloud is never static — it’s always growing with new technologies, new architectures, and new possibilities. I enjoy solving complex problems, streamlining operations, and seeing how cloud solutions make a tangible difference for businesses and people.
              For me, cloud engineering isn’t just a job — it’s about building the foundation for the future of technology, where innovation is limitless and businesses can reach their full potential.</p>
